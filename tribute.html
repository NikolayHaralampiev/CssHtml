		<h2>Early Life</h2>
		<p>
			Eminem was born on October 17, 1972, in St. Joseph, Missouri. He spent most of his childhood in Detroit,
			where he faced a difficult upbringing due to poverty, a troubled family life, and racial tension.When he was
			a child, a bully named D'Angelo Bailey severely injured Eminem's head in an assault, an incident which
			Eminem later recounted (with comic exaggeration) on the song <b>"Brain Damage"</b>.<br>At age 14, Eminem
			began rapping with high-school friend Mike Ruby. They adopted the names <b>"Manix"</b> and <b>"M&M"</b>, the
			latter
			evolving into "Eminem". Eminem sneaked into neighboring Osborn High School with friend and fellow
			rapper <b>Proof</b> for lunchroom freestyle rap battles. On Saturdays, they attended open mic contests at
			the
			Hip-Hop Shop on West 7 Mile Road, considered "ground zero" for the Detroit rap scene.

			Stephen Hill, the then vice president of African American-themed television network BET (Black Entertainment
			Television), said in 2002:<br><br>

			<i><b>Eminem gets a pass in the same vein that back during segregation black folks had to be better than
					average, had
					to be the best, to be accepted ... he is better than the best. In his own way, he is the best
					lyricist,
					alliterator and enunciator out there in hip-hop music. In terms of rapping about the pain that other
					disenfranchised people feel, there is no one better at their game than Eminem.</b>
